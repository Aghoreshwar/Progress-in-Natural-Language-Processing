# Part-of-speech tagging

Part-of-speech tagging (POS tagging) is the task of tagging a word in a text with its part of speech.
A part of speech is a category of words with similar grammatical properties. Common English
parts of speech are noun, verb, adjective, adverb, pronoun, preposition, conjunction, etc.

Example: 

| Vinken | , | 61 | years | old |
| --- | ---| --- | --- | --- |
| NNP | , | CD | NNS | JJ |

### UD

[Universal Dependencies (UD)](http://universaldependencies.org/) is a framework for 
cross-linguistic grammatical annotation, which contains more than 100 treebanks in over 60 languages.
Models are typically evaluated based on the average test accuracy across 28 languages.

### Penn Treebank

A standard dataset for POS tagging is the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) portion of the Penn Treebank, containing 45 
different POS tags. Sections 0-18 are used for training, sections 19-21 for development, and sections 
22-24 for testing. Models are evaluated based on accuracy.
