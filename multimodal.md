## Multimodal Emotion Recognition 

### IEMOCAP

The  IEMOCAP ([Busso  et  al., 2008](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10579-008-9076-6)) contains the acts of 10 speakers in a two-way conversation segmented into utterances. The medium of the conversations in all the videos is English. The database contains the following categorical labels: anger, happiness, sadness, neutral, excitement, frustration, fear, surprise,  and other.

**Conversational:**
Conversational setting enables the models to capture emotions expressed by the speakers in a conversation. Inter speaker dependencies are considered in this setting.

## Multimodal Sentiment Analysis

### MOSI
The MOSI dataset ([Zadeh et al., 2016](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.06259.pdf)) is a dataset rich in sentimental expressions where 93 people review topics in English. The videos are segmented with each segments sentiment label scored between +3 (strong positive) to -3 (strong negative)  by  5  annotators.
