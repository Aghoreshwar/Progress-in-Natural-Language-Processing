# Multi-task learning

Multi-task learning aims to learn multiple different tasks simultaneously while maximizing
performance on one or all of the tasks. 

### GLUE

The [General Language Understanding Evaluation benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.07461) (GLUE)
is a tool for evaluating and analyzing the performance of models across a diverse
range of existing natural language understanding tasks. Models are evaluated based on their
average accuracy across all tasks.

The state-of-the-art results can be seen on the public [GLUE leaderboard](https://gluebenchmark.com/leaderboard).
