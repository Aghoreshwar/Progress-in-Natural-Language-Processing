# Natural language inference

Natural language inference is the task of determining whether a "hypothesis" is 
true (entailment), false (contradiction), or undetermined (neutral) given a "premise".

Example:

| Premise | Label | Hypothesis |
| --- | ---| --- |
| A man inspects the uniform of a figure in some East Asian country. | contradiction | The man is sleeping. |
| An older and younger man smiling. | neutral  | Two men are smiling and laughing at the cats playing on the floor. |
| A soccer game with multiple males playing. | entailment | Some men are playing a sport. |

### SNLI

The [Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) Corpus](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.05326)
contains around 550k hypothesis/premise pairs. Models are evaluated based on accuracy.

State-of-the-art results can be seen on the [SNLI website](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/snli/).

### MultiNLI

The [Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference (MultiNLI) corpus](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.05426)
contains around 433k hypothesis/premise pairs. It is similar to the SNLI corpus, but
covers a range of genres of spoken and written text and supports cross-genre evaluation. The data
can be downloaded from the [MultiNLI](https://www.nyu.edu/projects/bowman/multinli/) website.

Public leaderboards for [in-genre (matched)](https://www.kaggle.com/c/multinli-matched-open-evaluation/leaderboard) 
and [cross-genre (mismatched)](https://www.kaggle.com/c/multinli-mismatched-open-evaluation/leaderboard)
evaluation are available, but entries do not correspond to published models.

### SciTail

The [SciTail](http://ai2-website.s3.amazonaws.com/publications/scitail-aaai-2018_cameraready.pdf)
entailment dataset consists of 27k. In contrast to the SNLI and MultiNLI, it was not crowd-sourced
but created from sentences that already exist "in the wild". Hypotheses were created from
science questions and the corresponding answer candidates, while relevant web sentences from a large
corpus were used as premises. Models are evaluated based on accuracy.
