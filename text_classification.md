# Text classification

Text classification is the task of assigning a sentence or document an appropriate category.
The categories depend on the chosen dataset and can range from topics.

### AG News

The [AG News corpus](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5782-character-level-convolutional-networks-for-text-classification.pdf)
consists of news articles from the [AG's corpus of news articles on the web](http://www.di.unipi.it/~gulli/AG_corpus_of_news_articles.html)
pertaining to the 4 largest classes. The dataset contains 30,000 training examples for each class
1,900 examples for each class for testing. Models are evaluated based on error rate (lower is better).

### DBpedia

The [DBpedia ontology](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5782-character-level-convolutional-networks-for-text-classification.pdf) 
dataset contains 40,000 training samples and 5,000 testing samples for each of 14 nonoverlapping classes from DBpedia.
Models are evaluated based on error rate (lower is better).

### TREC

The [TREC dataset](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.11.2766&rep=rep1&type=pdf) is dataset for
question classification consisting of open-domain, fact-based questions divided into broad semantic categories. 
It has both a six-class (TREC-6) and a fifty-class (TREC-50) version. Both have 4,300 training examples, 
but TREC-50 has finer-grained labels. Models are evaluated based on accuracy.
