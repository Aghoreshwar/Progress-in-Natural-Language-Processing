# Semantic role labeling

Semantic role labeling aims to model the predicate-argument structure of a sentence
and is often described as answering "Who did what to whom". BIO notation is typically
used for semantic role labeling.

Example:

| Housing | starts | are | expected | to | quicken | a | bit | from | August’s | pace | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| B-ARG1 | I-ARG1 | O |  O  |  O  |   V  | B-ARG2 | I-ARG2 | B-ARG3 | I-ARG3 | I-ARG3 |    

### OntoNotes

Models are typically evaluated on the [OntoNotes benchmark](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W13-3516) based on F1.
